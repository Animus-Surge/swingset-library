            The resources tree defines any and all resources used by the scene, including images, scripts, audio, etc.

            When using the scene utility, by default all resources are res#, but this is not required as long as you load the correct resource from the list.

            Resource nodes are required to have the following parameters:
                id - The ID of the resource, used when loading from this list (Resources can be loaded directly from the node, bypassing this check altogether)
                type - Defines how this resource should be loaded and where to place it
                resourcepath - Defines where this resource is physically stored
            
            There are no optional parameters for the resource node.

<!--Documentation will be created for the game engine as well to ease the task of figuring it out on your own when
manuallly making scenes-->
