			The resources tree defines any and all resources used by the scene, including images, scripts, audio, etc.

			When using the scene utility (Currently not available), by default all resources are res#, but this is not required as long as you load the correct resource from the list.

			Resource nodes are required to have the following parameters:
				id - The ID of the resource, used when loading from this list (Resources can be loaded directly from the node, bypassing this check altogether)
				type - Defines how this resource should be loaded and where to place it
				resourcepath - Defines where this resource is physically stored
			
			There are no optional parameters for the resource node.
