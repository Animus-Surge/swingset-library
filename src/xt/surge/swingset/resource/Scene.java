 * A scene is a group of nodes that collectively form a part of a game. For example,

 * game scene would have all the game objects, and the main menu scene has the
 * main menu. Scenes are stored in a custom XML format. Refer to the github wiki
 * page on scenes for more information and how-tos on making scenes.
