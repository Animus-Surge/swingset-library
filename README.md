# Swingset

Swingset is a 2D java game library using the default swing and awt packages to render everything.

## Why?

Because why not. Java swing in later releases is actually pretty good, and the interface is very versatile.
Maybe not the best choice for 3D games, but a perfect opportunity to get started making 2D games.

## What's planned?

Right now, the plan is to get the engine itself working. Eventually there'll be a utility
to create scenes and resources, but for now the engine is the main priority. Here is a basic
list that outlines what we have planned.

- Physics
- UI framework

# How to use

Currently, there isn't much use for this engine. If you'd like to see what there is so far,
feel free to run the `compile.bat`/`compile.sh` scripts, followed by the `run.bat`/`run.sh`
scripts to run the current test system.

# Documentation

See the wiki for the documentation. Additionally, the program contains information for
javadocs, which can be built by running the `buildjdocs.bat` or `buildjdocs.sh` files.

Please note that running any of the scripts provided assumes that you have at least jdk 14
on your PATH variable. If you don't have it, you can get it at [https://java.oracle.com/].
