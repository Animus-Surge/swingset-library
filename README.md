# Swingset

Swingset is a 2D java game library using the default swing and awt packages to render everything.

## Why?

Because why not. Java swing in later releases is actually pretty good, and the interface is very versatile.
Maybe not the best choice for 3D games, but a perfect opportunity to get started making 2D games.

## What's planned?

Right now, the plan is to get the engine itself working. Eventually there'll be a utility
to create scenes and resources, but for now the engine is the main priority. Here is a basic
list that outlines what we have planned.

- Physics
- UI framework
